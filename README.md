# Nutcracker IDE #

Nutracker is an IDE purely focused on the [Squirrel scripting language](http://squirrel-lang.org).
I've used Squirrel on and off over the years, but despite being a nice little scripting language, I was always put off by the lack of tools.

The code is mostly a refactoring of the C/Assembly IDE I've been working on for my game toolkit:

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIyHgQvfETE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIyHgQvfETE)

As such, it's pretty much unorganized while I refactor and bring things across as fast as possible, so don't expect pretty code.

Also, this repository references code from another one of my repositories which is not public at the moment, so you won't be able to build.
I'll get that sorted out as soon as I have a usable version.
